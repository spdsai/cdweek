Hey there , It's me Subhash Patel 
I am from department(^school) of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 
My Roll no. is 210150017

don't have much hobbies but for sake of telling playing badminton, among us,programming (interested in webd , ai and cybersec) binge watching series (just ended Season 4 of Stranger things ;)
yeah ,That's pretty much all about me 

I want to contribute for open source as it is a great cause, due to these contributions only we are able to such great software like blender. The community work is what appeals most to me.
